**Flutter Clean Architecture 🧼**
                                   
_A robust Flutter project template featuring:_

🌐 Internationalization: Seamlessly adapt to different languages and locales.
🎨 Themes: Easily customize your app's appearance with multiple themes.
🧩 Global Widgets: Reusable UI components for consistent design.
🛡️ Error Handling: Graceful error management for a smooth user experience.
🚦 Flutter Bloc: State management using the Flutter Bloc pattern.
❄️ Freezed: Code generation for immutable data classes.
💉 Get It: Dependency Injection for clean and maintainable code.
Clean Architecture is a software design pattern that promotes separation of concerns and testability. In Flutter, it organizes your code into layers:

**Presentation Layer:** Handles user interaction and UI elements.
**Domain Layer:** Contains the core business logic and domain entities.
**Data Layer:** Interacts with data sources like APIs and databases.
